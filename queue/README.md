#Queue

Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks.
 Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. 
 One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). 
 Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.

As we now understand that in queue, we access both ends for different reasons. The following diagram given below tries to explain queue representation as data structure −

As in stacks, a queue can also be implemented using Arrays, Linked-lists, Pointers and Structures. For the sake of simplicity, we shall implement queues using one-dimensional array and also with using linked list.

**Basic Operations** 
---
Queue operations may involve initializing or defining the queue, utilizing it, and then completely erasing it from the memory. Here we shall try to understand the basic operations associated with queues −

**enqueue()** − add (store) an item to the queue.

**dequeue()** − remove (access) an item from the queue.
